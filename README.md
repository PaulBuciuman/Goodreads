Hi! Thanks for visiting my project. The purpose of this project is to provide an interface that can help readers search and filter information about books from the Goodreads website. I scraped some data about books and authors from the website into the local database and I wrote queries in order to clean,arrange and analyse the dataset. Most of the backend functionality is done. Currently I'm working on developing a basic UI for this application.

The queries that I used in order to manipulate the data can be found in this project as well (Cleaning.sql and Analyse.sql)
